Astro::SLA -- interface to C SLALIB library
==========

Requirements:

 - This module requires the C version of the SLALIB library
   written by Pat Wallace. It will not work with the Starlink
   (FORTRAN) version of SLALIB.

   It has been tested with the May 1998 release of SLALIB.


Installation:

 - Edit the Makefile.PL so that the location of the SLA
   library and include files are correct

Then:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

Currently there is only one test (converting B1950 to J2000).
